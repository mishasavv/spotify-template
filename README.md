various sites, such as stack overflow, spotify developer site etc. Used eddiemoore's angular-spotify library to assit with project

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

30-40

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

I had a lot of issues with authentication, which may be something to point out, and the promise structure took way too long to figure out. The problem was only apparent when I was almost done, and it took a lot of time and research to resolve. For something like this, it's very important to review this material beforehand, because it took hours of research to even figure out what the issue was and why things were running out of order.
